## üöÄ Quick Success Path (10 Minutes)

### Step 1: Install MCP Server (2 minutes)

**Option A: Pre-built Release (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install as global .NET tool
dotnet tool install -g VisualStudioMcp.Server

# Verify installation
vsmcp --version
```

**Option B: Build from Source**
```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/your-org/MCP-VS-AUTOMATION.git
cd MCP-VS-AUTOMATION
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

### Step 2: Configure Claude Code (3 minutes)

**Add MCP Server to Claude Code Configuration:**

Create or edit your Claude Code MCP configuration file:

**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\claude-code\mcp-servers.json`  
**Linux:** `~/.config/claude-code/mcp-servers.json`

```json

## üîß Common Integration Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Daily Development Workflow

**Morning Setup:**
```
Claude: "List all Visual Studio instances and connect to the one running MyProject"
```

**Development Tasks:**
```
Claude: "Build the solution and show me any warnings or errors"
Claude: "Show me all projects in the solution with their target frameworks"
Claude: "Open the WebAPI solution in the second Visual Studio instance"
```

**Before Committing:**
```
Claude: "Build the solution in Release configuration to check for any issues"
```

### Scenario 2: Multi-Solution Management

**When working with multiple solutions:**
```
Claude: "List all Visual Studio instances"
Claude: "Connect to process 15420 (the one with the WebAPI solution)"
Claude: "Build this solution while I work on the other one"
Claude: "Switch to process 18750 (the mobile app solution)"
```

### Scenario 3: Solution Analysis

**Understanding a new codebase:**
```
Claude: "Open the solution at C:\\Projects\\NewProject\\NewProject.sln"
Claude: "Show me all projects in this solution with their types"
Claude: "Build the solution and let me know if there are any errors"
```

### Scenario 4: Automated Build Verification

**Pre-deployment checks:**
```
Claude: "Build the solution in Release configuration"
Claude: "If the build succeeds, show me the output path and built assemblies"
Claude: "Check if there are any warnings I should address"
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security and Safety Features

### Input Validation
- **Process ID Security:** Only valid Visual Studio processes can be targeted
- **Path Security:** Protection against directory traversal attacks
- **File Type Validation:** Only `.sln` files can be opened
- **Process Verification:** Confirms target process is actually Visual Studio

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation:** MCP server continues operating if VS crashes
- **Health Monitoring:** Automatic detection and cleanup of disconnected instances
- **Detailed Error Messages:** Clear, actionable error information without security disclosure

### Resource Management
- **Memory Safety:** Weak references prevent COM object memory leaks
- **Connection Cleanup:** Automatic disposal of dead connections
- **Process Monitoring:** Health checks ensure reliable operation

## üîç Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "No Visual Studio instances found"

**Symptoms:**
```
Claude responds: "I don't see any running Visual Studio instances."
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify Visual Studio is running:**
   ```powershell
   Get-Process devenv
   ```

2. **Check COM registration:**
   ```powershell
   # Re-register Visual Studio COM components
   & "${env:ProgramFiles}\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2022\\Professional\\Common7\\IDE\\devenv.exe" /regserver
   ```

3. **Restart MCP server:**
   ```bash
   # If running as service, restart it
   vsmcp --restart
   ```

### Issue: "Connection failed to Visual Studio instance"

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: "Failed to connect to Visual Studio instance - Access denied"
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Run with administrator privileges** (if corporate environment)
2. **Check antivirus/firewall** blocking COM access
3. **Verify Visual Studio version compatibility** (requires VS 2022 17.8+)

### Issue: "Build failed with COM errors"

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: "Build operation failed - COM object has been separated from its underlying RCW"
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Restart Visual Studio** to refresh COM objects
2. **Close unnecessary VS instances** to reduce COM pressure
3. **Check available memory** - COM objects need sufficient resources

### Issue: "Path validation failed"

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: "Path contains potential traversal attempts"
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Use absolute paths only:** `C:\\Projects\\MySolution.sln`
2. **Avoid relative references:** Don't use `..\\` or `~\\`
3. **Check file exists:** Ensure the `.sln` file actually exists

### Issue: "MCP server not responding"

**Diagnostic Steps:**
```bash
# Check if MCP server is running
ps aux | grep vsmcp

# Test direct connection
echo '{"method":"tools/list"}' | vsmcp

# Check Claude Code MCP configuration
cat ~/.config/claude-code/mcp-servers.json
```

## ‚ö° Performance Tips

### Optimise for Speed
- **Keep Visual Studio instances minimal** - Close unnecessary solutions
- **Use specific process IDs** - More efficient than auto-discovery
- **Build incrementally** - Use Debug configuration during development
- **Monitor memory usage** - Restart VS if memory usage exceeds 2GB

### Best Practices
- **One solution per VS instance** for better isolation
- **Regular VS restarts** during long development sessions
- **Use specific commands** rather than asking Claude to figure out what you want
- **Batch operations** when possible (e.g., "build all projects")
