**Example Enhancement:**
```markdown
## vs_list_instances Tool

### Purpose
Lists all running Visual Studio instances with metadata for connection.

### Request Format
```json
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "vs_list_instances",
    "arguments": {}
  }
}
```

### Response Format  
```json
{
  "result": {
    "instances": [
      {
        "processId": 12345,
        "version": "17.8.0", 
        "solutionPath": "C:\\Dev\\MySolution.sln",
        "isHealthy": true
      }
    ],
    "count": 1,
    "timestamp": "2025-08-12T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Claude Code Usage Example
```python
# Connect to Claude Code and use the tool
instances = await claude_code.call_tool("vs_list_instances")
if instances["result"]["count"] > 0:
    target_instance = instances["result"]["instances"][0]
    print(f"Found VS instance: PID {target_instance['processId']}")
```

### Common Issues & Solutions
- **No instances found:** Ensure Visual Studio is running and COM registration is valid
- **Access denied:** Run with appropriate permissions or check firewall settings
```
