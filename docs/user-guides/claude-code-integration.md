# Claude Code Integration Guide

This guide provides comprehensive examples of using the Visual Studio MCP Server with Claude Code for effective development workflows.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio MCP Server installed (see [Installation Guide](../operations/installation-guide.md))
- Visual Studio 2022 running with a solution loaded
- Claude Code properly configured with MCP server connection

### Basic Workflow
1. Start Visual Studio 2022 and open your solution
2. Open Claude Code
3. Begin your development session with VS automation

## Common Development Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Project Analysis and Understanding

**Situation:** You've inherited a large codebase and need to understand its structure.

```
List all running Visual Studio instances and connect to the one with the largest solution
```

Claude Code will:
1. Discover VS instances
2. Connect to the appropriate one
3. Provide solution overview

**Follow-up commands:**
```
Show me all projects in this solution with their target frameworks and dependencies

Capture the complete IDE layout so I can see how the solution is organized

Build the entire solution and show me any warnings or errors that need attention
```

### Scenario 2: Debugging Session Management

**Situation:** You need to debug a complex issue with multiple breakpoints.

```
Start debugging the startup project and set a breakpoint at UserService.cs line 42 with condition "userId > 100"
```

**Advanced debugging workflow:**
```
Show me the current debug state with call stack and local variables

Step over the current line and evaluate the expression "user.Name"

Get all local variables at this breakpoint and show me their values

Capture a screenshot of the current debugging session for documentation
```

**Debugging session cleanup:**
```
Stop the debugging session and show me a summary of breakpoints hit
```

### Scenario 3: XAML UI Development

**Situation:** Developing a WPF application with complex XAML layouts.

```
Capture the XAML designer for MainWindow.xaml with annotations showing element boundaries
```

**XAML analysis and modification:**
```
Analyse all data bindings in MainWindow.xaml and show me any validation warnings

Get all XAML elements in the current designer and show me their property values

Change the LoginButton content from "Login" to "Sign In" and capture the updated designer
```

**Data binding troubleshooting:**
```
Analyse bindings in CustomerView.xaml and provide performance recommendations

Find all elements with names containing "Button" in the current XAML file
```

### Scenario 4: Build and Error Resolution

**Situation:** Build is failing and you need to identify and fix issues systematically.

```
Build the solution and show me all errors with their locations and suggested fixes
```

**Error resolution workflow:**
```
Show me the Error List window and Properties panel to understand the current state

Build just the Core project to isolate the issue

Capture the complete IDE state including Error List for team review
```

**Verification after fixes:**
```
Build the solution in Release mode and verify no warnings remain

Run all unit tests and show me the results
```

### Scenario 5: Visual State Documentation

**Situation:** Creating documentation or training materials showing IDE states.

```
Capture the complete Visual Studio IDE showing the Solution Explorer, code editor, and Properties panel
```

**Documentation workflow:**
```
Capture the code editor showing UserService.cs with syntax highlighting

Take a screenshot of the Properties window for the selected UI element

Analyse the current visual state and compare it with the previous capture to show changes
```

## Advanced Workflows

### Multi-Instance Development

When working with multiple VS instances:

```
List all Visual Studio instances and show me which solutions they have open

Connect to the instance running the CustomerPortal solution

Switch to the instance with the AdminTools solution and build that project
```

### Performance Monitoring

For performance-sensitive development:

```
Build the solution and monitor the build time - flag if it takes longer than 2 minutes

Start debugging with performance monitoring enabled

Capture memory usage during debugging session
```

### Automated Quality Checks

Before code review or commits:

```
Build the entire solution in Release mode and ensure zero warnings

Run all unit tests and show me coverage statistics

Capture screenshots of all major UI windows for documentation
```

## Claude Code Prompt Patterns

### Effective Prompt Structures

**Discovery Pattern:**
```
List/Show/Get [target] and [additional context]

Example: "List all projects and show me their NuGet dependencies"
```

**Action Pattern:**  
```
[Action] [target] [parameters] and [follow-up]

Example: "Build the Core project in Debug mode and show me any compilation errors"
```

**Capture Pattern:**
```
Capture [target] [with/including] [specifications]

Example: "Capture the XAML designer with element annotations and save with timestamp"
```

**Analysis Pattern:**
```
Analyse [target] and [provide/show/recommend] [output type]

Example: "Analyse all data bindings and provide performance recommendations"
```

### Chaining Commands

Claude Code can execute multiple related commands in sequence:

```
Connect to Visual Studio, open the MyApp solution, build it in Release mode, and then start debugging with breakpoints at the main entry points
```

This will result in Claude Code:
1. Connecting to VS instance
2. Opening the specified solution  
3. Building in Release configuration
4. Setting appropriate breakpoints
5. Starting debugging session

### Conditional Logic

Use conditional statements for adaptive workflows:

```
If the build fails, show me the first 5 errors with their file locations and suggested fixes. If it succeeds, start debugging the application.
```

### Context-Aware Commands

Claude Code maintains context across commands:

```
Build the solution
// After build completes...
If there were any warnings, show me the XAML files involved and capture their designers
```

## Integration Patterns

### IDE State Management

**Save and Restore Patterns:**
```
Capture the current IDE layout as "before-refactoring"

// ... perform refactoring work ...

Capture the current IDE layout as "after-refactoring" and compare with the previous state
```

**Progress Tracking:**
```
Before starting: Capture current state and note any existing errors

During work: Build periodically and track error count changes  

After completion: Verify final state with clean build and zero errors
```

### Documentation Generation

**API Documentation:**
```
Capture screenshots of all major classes in the Solution Explorer

For each public method in UserService.cs, capture the code editor showing the method signature

Create visual documentation showing the XAML designer states for all user controls
```

**Troubleshooting Documentation:**
```
Capture the Error List showing the current compilation issues

Document the debugging session by capturing each step: breakpoint, local variables, call stack

Show the visual diff between the working state and the problematic state
```

### Quality Assurance Workflows

**Pre-Commit Checklist:**
```
1. Build solution in Release mode - ensure zero errors and warnings
2. Run all unit tests - verify 100% pass rate  
3. Capture IDE state showing clean Error List
4. Verify debugging works by testing main execution paths
```

**Code Review Preparation:**
```
Capture screenshots of all modified XAML designers showing UI changes

Document debugging scenarios with annotated breakpoint captures

Show build output demonstrating successful compilation
```

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Common Error Scenarios

**MCP Server Connection Issues:**
```
If you get "MCP server not responding", try: List Visual Studio instances to reconnect
```

**Visual Studio State Issues:**
```
If commands fail, try: Capture the current IDE state to see what's happening, then reconnect
```

**Build Problems:**
```
If build hangs, try: Stop any running builds, then build just one project to isolate the issue
```

### Recovery Patterns

**Session Recovery:**
```
List all Visual Studio instances to re-establish connection

Get current solution information to understand the state

Show current debugging status to resume where we left off
```

**State Verification:**
```
Capture the complete IDE to verify current state

Check if any solutions are loaded and what their build status is

Verify debugging session is active or stopped as expected
```

## Performance Optimization

### Efficient Command Usage

**Batch Related Operations:**
```
Connect to Visual Studio, get solution info, and show project dependencies in one request
```

**Target Specific Operations:**
```
Instead of: "Show me everything about the solution"
Use: "Show me projects with compilation errors and their specific error messages"
```

**Use Appropriate Detail Levels:**
```
For quick checks: "Build status and error count"
For detailed analysis: "Complete build output with all warnings and recommendations"
```

### Resource Management

**Screenshot Considerations:**
```
For documentation: Use high-quality captures with annotations
For quick checks: Use standard quality to reduce processing time
For large IDEs: Capture specific windows rather than full IDE when possible
```

**Memory Considerations:**
```
Close debugging sessions when finished to free resources
Limit concurrent Visual Studio instances when possible
Clear temporary capture files periodically
```

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow Integration

1. **Start of Day Routine:**
   ```
   List Visual Studio instances and connect to my main development solution
   Build the solution to verify clean starting state
   ```

2. **Feature Development:**
   ```
   Before changes: Capture current IDE state as baseline
   During development: Build frequently and monitor error trends
   After changes: Verify with clean build and debugging test
   ```

3. **End of Day:**
   ```
   Build solution in Release mode for final verification
   Stop all debugging sessions
   Capture final IDE state for next day reference
   ```

### Team Collaboration

**Sharing IDE States:**
```
Capture complete IDE layout showing the debugging session
Include Error List and Output windows in team communication
Document XAML designer states for UI review sessions
```

**Standardized Workflows:**
```
Use consistent capture naming: project-feature-timestamp
Include build configuration and target framework in descriptions
Provide context about what was being debugged or developed
```

### Documentation Standards

**Screenshot Annotations:**
- Always include annotations for XAML captures
- Use high-quality settings for documentation
- Include timestamp and project context

**Command Documentation:**
- Save successful command sequences for reuse
- Document any custom parameters or configurations
- Note performance characteristics for large operations

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Connection Issues

**Symptom:** Commands not working with Visual Studio
**Solution:**
```
List all Visual Studio instances to verify connection
If none found, ensure VS 2022 is running with a solution loaded
Try reconnecting: Connect to the instance with the correct solution
```

### Performance Issues

**Symptom:** Slow response times
**Solution:**
```
Check if multiple VS instances are running - close unnecessary ones
Verify system resources aren't constrained
Use targeted commands rather than broad "show everything" requests
```

### Capture Issues

**Symptom:** Screenshots not capturing correctly
**Solution:**
```
Ensure target windows are visible and not minimized
Try capturing specific windows rather than full IDE
Check if other applications are overlaying VS windows
```
