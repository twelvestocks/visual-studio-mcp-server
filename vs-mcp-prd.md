# Visual Studio MCP Server - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview
**Project Name:** Visual Studio MCP Server  
**Date:** 12 August 2025  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Owner:** Automint Ltd Development Team  

**Executive Summary:**
A dedicated Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides Claude Code with comprehensive Visual Studio automation capabilities, including debugging control, XAML designer interaction, and visual context capture. This enables Claude Code to see the complete development picture and manipulate Visual Studio beyond MSBuild limitations.

**Problem Statement:**
Claude Code currently lacks the ability to interact with Visual Studio's rich development environment, particularly for debugging, XAML design, and visual context understanding. This limits its effectiveness in solving complex development problems that require runtime inspection, visual analysis, and interactive debugging capabilities.

**Success Metrics:**
- Claude Code can successfully start, control, and monitor debugging sessions
- XAML designer surfaces can be captured and analysed by Claude Code
- Development productivity increases by 30% for Visual Studio-based projects
- Debugging session context is fully available to Claude Code for problem analysis

## 2. User Requirements

**Target Users:**
- **Primary:** Software developers at Automint Ltd using Visual Studio with Claude Code
- **Secondary:** Development team leads requiring comprehensive project oversight and debugging assistance

**User Stories:**
- As a developer, I want Claude Code to see my XAML designer surface so that it can help me fix layout and binding issues visually
- As a developer, I want Claude Code to control debugging sessions so that it can step through code and analyse runtime state
- As a developer, I want Claude Code to capture Visual Studio output windows so that it can analyse build errors and debug information in context
- As a developer, I want Claude Code to see the complete Visual Studio state so that it can provide more accurate development assistance
- As a team lead, I want Claude Code to have comprehensive project visibility so that it can assist with complex technical decisions

**User Journey:**
1. Developer encounters a complex debugging or XAML issue in Visual Studio
2. Developer requests Claude Code assistance via MCP tools
3. Claude Code captures current Visual Studio state (windows, debug info, XAML designer)
4. Claude Code analyses the visual and runtime context
