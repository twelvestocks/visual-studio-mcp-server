## Performance and Efficiency Tips

### Optimizing Visual Studio MCP Server Usage

**Efficient Command Sequencing:**
```
// Instead of multiple separate commands:
List Visual Studio instances
Connect to instance vs_12345
Build solution
Start debugging

// Use compound commands:
Connect to the Visual Studio instance with the MyApp solution, build it, and start debugging with breakpoints at main entry points
```

**Resource-Conscious Capture:**
```
// For quick checks - use targeted captures:
Capture just the Error List window showing current build issues

// For documentation - use high-quality full captures:
Capture complete IDE with annotations for architecture documentation
```

**Debugging Session Management:**
```
// Always clean up debugging sessions:
Stop debugging session when analysis is complete
Clear unnecessary breakpoints to improve performance
Close excess Visual Studio instances to free resources
```

### Best Practices for Team Usage

**Standardized Workflows:**
- Define team conventions for capture naming and organization
- Create templates for common workflow sequences
- Document custom configurations for team consistency

**Performance Monitoring:**
- Track MCP server response times for performance regression detection
- Monitor Visual Studio resource usage during automated sessions
- Optimize command sequences based on team usage patterns

**Documentation Standards:**
- Include context and timestamp in all captures
- Use consistent annotation styles for team review
- Maintain libraries of common workflow examples
