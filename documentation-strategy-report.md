- **Risk:** Technical documentation too complex for users
- **Mitigation:** Separate technical and user documentation clearly

- **Risk:** Code examples break with updates
- **Mitigation:** Automated testing of documentation code examples

### Project Risks
- **Risk:** Documentation effort delays development
- **Mitigation:** Phased approach with critical documentation first

- **Risk:** Inadequate documentation affects user adoption
- **Mitigation:** User testing and feedback incorporation process

## Conclusion

The Visual Studio MCP Server project requires comprehensive documentation to achieve its goals of enhancing Claude Code's Visual Studio automation capabilities. The phased approach outlined in this strategy ensures that critical documentation is available immediately while building toward complete coverage over 6 weeks.

The recommended structure balances the needs of different audiences:
- **Developers** need architecture, API, and setup documentation
- **Users** need integration guides and workflow examples
- **Operations** need installation, monitoring, and troubleshooting guides

Success depends on treating documentation as a critical component of the development process, with regular review, testing, and updates integrated into the standard workflow.

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Create `/docs` directory structure
2. Begin Phase 1 documentation (README.md, setup guide, architecture overview)
3. Establish documentation review process
4. Set up validation procedures for code examples

This documentation strategy will ensure the Visual Studio MCP Server project has the foundation needed for successful development, deployment, and user adoption within the Claude Code ecosystem.
